# Training Planner

## Quick Start
Design structured training programs with clear learning objectives, schedules, resource requirements, and progress tracking. Support individual development plans and team-wide training initiatives.

## Workflow
1. Identify training need: skills gap, new hire onboarding, compliance, career development, team upskilling
2. Define learning objectives and success criteria
3. Design the training structure: modules, duration, format (online/offline/blended)
4. Create a schedule with resources and facilitators
5. Set up progress tracking and assessment methods
6. Estimate budget and logistics requirements

## Examples

**Example 1: Team Training Plan**
Input: "Create an advanced Excel training plan for the accounting department, 10 people"
Output:
```

```

**Example 2: Individual Development Plan**
Input: "Create a 6-month development plan for a junior developer transitioning to team lead"
Output: A phased plan with skill-building modules, mentoring schedule, and milestone checkpoints.

## Tools
- Use `Read` to load training materials, competency frameworks, or employee records
- Use `Write` to save training plans and schedules
- Use `WebSearch` to find training resources, courses, or certification programs
- Use `Bash` to calculate schedules and durations

## Error Handling
- If skill gaps not specified → suggest a skills assessment first
- If budget not provided → estimate and flag for approval
- If trainer availability unknown → create schedule with placeholder and note dependency
- If timeline is too aggressive → suggest phased approach with priorities

## Rules
- Every training plan must include: objectives, schedule, resources, assessment, and budget
- Learning objectives should be measurable and specific (use action verbs: build, create, analyze)
- Maximum 2 hours per session for optimal attention and retention
- Include practice time — minimum 40% hands-on vs theory
- Track attendance and completion rates
- Assessment must have a clear pass/fail threshold
- Budget estimates should include all costs: trainer, materials, venue, certificates
- Suggest follow-up or refresher sessions for complex topics

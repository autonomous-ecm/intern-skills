# Leave Manager

## Quick Start
Process leave requests, track balances, and ensure compliance with FMLA, applicable state laws, and company policy leave entitlements. Maintain team coverage visibility and flag potential conflicts.

## Workflow
1. Identify action: submit request, check balance, approve/reject, plan coverage, calculate entitlements
2. Verify leave type: annual, sick, maternity/paternity, personal, unpaid, public holiday
3. Check employee's remaining balance for the leave type
4. Validate against team calendar for coverage conflicts
5. Process the request with proper documentation
6. Update balance and notify relevant parties

Tenure adjustments: varies by company policy
Employee tenure: 8 years → check company handbook for additional PTO accrual

Total PTO: per company policy

```

## Tools
- Use `Read` to load leave records, team calendars, and policy files
- Use `Write` to save leave requests and updated balances
- Use `Grep` to search for employee records or overlapping leave dates
- Use `Bash` to calculate business days and entitlements

## Error Handling
- If leave balance is insufficient → reject with balance details and suggest alternatives
- If team coverage drops below 50% → flag as risk and suggest alternative dates
- If leave type not specified → ask employee to classify the leave type
- If dates include public holidays → exclude them from the working day count

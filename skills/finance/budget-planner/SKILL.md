# Budget Planner

## Quick Start
Build and analyze budget plans for any scope (company, department, project) and period (monthly, quarterly, yearly). Separates fixed from variable costs, applies contingency reserves, and flags categories approaching their limits.

## Workflow
1. Determine budget scope: company-wide, department, or project
2. Identify budget period: monthly, quarterly, or yearly
3. Classify request: new budget, mid-period adjustment, variance analysis, or forecast
4. Gather baseline data: historical spending, known commitments, planned initiatives
5. Separate fixed costs (rent, salaries) from variable costs (marketing, travel)
6. Calculate allocations per category based on historical trends and stated priorities
7. Apply 5-10% contingency reserve
8. For variance analysis: compute actual vs. planned with absolute and percentage differences
9. Flag any category exceeding 70% of monthly allocation
10. Output budget document with summary, detail, insights, and recommendations

WARNINGS
--------
- Cloud Services: 21% over budget - investigate usage spike

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
- Review cloud resource provisioning to reduce overspend
- Reallocate unused equipment budget to cover cloud costs
```

## Tools
- Use `Read` to load historical budget files and prior-period actuals
- Use `Grep` to search for department or category spending patterns
- Use `Write` to save new or updated budget plans
- Use `Bash` to run aggregation, variance, and trend calculations

## Error Handling
- If period or scope is not specified -> ask user to define period and scope
- If historical data is unavailable -> create budget from scratch using estimates, noting the absence of baseline
- If actual data is incomplete for variance analysis -> analyze available data and note gaps
- If category totals exceed stated budget -> highlight overage and suggest rebalancing

## Rules
- Always include a 5-10% contingency reserve
- Clearly distinguish fixed costs from variable costs
- Compare with the same prior-year period when data is available
- Trigger early warning when any category exceeds 70% of monthly budget
- Use abbreviated formats: thousands (K), millions (M), billions (B)
- Category totals must sum to the overall budget total
- Round to two decimal places for USD

TAX CALCULATION: Federal Income Tax - Gross to Net
====================================================

INPUT
-----
- Gross salary: $5,000/month ($60,000/year)
- Filing status: Single
- Dependents: 1 child

CALCULATION
-----------
Step 1: Social Security tax (6.2%)
       $5,000 x 6.2% = $310.00

Step 2: Medicare tax (1.45%)
       $5,000 x 1.45% = $72.50

Step 3: Total FICA deductions
       $310.00 + $72.50 = $382.50

Step 4: Standard deduction (annualized monthly)
       $14,600 / 12 = $1,216.67

Step 5: Taxable income (monthly)
       $5,000 - $382.50 - $1,216.67 = $3,400.83

Step 6: Federal income tax (progressive brackets, monthly estimate)
       $996.67 x 10% = $99.67
       $2,404.16 x 12% = $288.50
       Total federal tax = $388.17

Step 7: Child tax credit (monthly)
       $2,000 / 12 = $166.67

RESULT
------
Net salary:      $3,895.50/month

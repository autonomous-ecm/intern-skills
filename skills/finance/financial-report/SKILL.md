# Financial Report Generator

## Quick Start
Generate structured financial reports with period-over-period comparisons, material variance highlighting, trend analysis, and actionable recommendations. Supports P&L, Cash Flow, Balance Sheet, Dashboard, and Variance Analysis report types.

## Workflow
1. Identify the report type: P&L, Cash Flow, Balance Sheet, Financial Dashboard, or Variance Analysis
2. Determine reporting period: month, quarter, year, or custom range
3. Identify comparison basis: YoY, MoM, QoQ, or actual vs. budget
4. Load financial data for current and comparison periods
5. Calculate primary figures: revenue, expenses, profit margins, cash positions
6. Compute period-over-period changes (absolute and percentage)
7. Highlight material variances (>10% change)
8. Analyze trends and identify patterns (growth, cost creep, seasonal effects)
9. Compose analytical narrative and actionable recommendations
10. Assemble complete report with summary, detail, analysis, and recommendations

## Examples

**Example 1: Monthly P&L report**
Input: "Generate a P&L report for February 2026 vs January 2026"
Output:
```

MATERIAL VARIANCES (>10% change)
---------------------------------
- COGS: $340K vs. $300K (+13.3%) - Higher input costs
- Marketing: $60K vs. $50K (+20.0%) - Seasonal campaign spend

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
- Investigate COGS increase; negotiate supplier pricing
- Measure ROI on increased marketing spend

**Example 2: Quarterly dashboard**
Input: "Financial dashboard for Q1 2026"
Output:
```
FINANCIAL REPORT: Dashboard - Q1/2026
======================================

SUMMARY
-------
Revenue:      $2.4M (+12% vs. Q1/2025)

Net Profit:   $650K (Margin: 27.1%)
Cash Position: $1.2M

KEY METRICS
-----------
| KPI                  | Q1/2026 | Q1/2025 | Trend |
|----------------------|---------|---------|-------|
| Gross Margin         | 42%     | 40%     | +     |

| Expense Ratio        | 73%     | 75%     | +     |

ANALYSIS
--------
Q1 2026 shows healthy growth with improving margins. Revenue growth
accelerated from 8% to 12% YoY driven by new product lines. Expense
ratio improved by 2 percentage points, indicating better cost control.

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
- Continue investment in high-margin product lines
- Set Q2 revenue target at $2.6M based on growth trajectory

## Tools
- Use `Read` to load financial data files, prior-period reports, and KPI references
- Use `Grep` to search for specific line items, accounts, or transactions
- Use `Bash` to run aggregations, percentage changes, margin computations, and trend analysis
- Use `Write` to save completed reports and dashboard snapshots

## Error Handling
- If report type is not specified -> present the five supported types and ask user to select
- If data for the requested period is unavailable -> offer to work with the closest available period or user-supplied figures
- If comparison period data is missing -> generate current-period report only, noting comparative analysis is unavailable
- If figures do not reconcile -> flag discrepancy, identify source, and resolve before output
- If an unsupported metric is requested -> attempt to derive from available data or explain what is needed

## Rules
- All figures must be accurate and cross-checked; totals must reconcile
- Always include period-over-period comparison when comparison data is available
- Highlight any line item with >10% variance vs. comparison period
- Round to two decimal places for USD; note currency unit clearly
- Use abbreviated formats: thousands (K), millions (M), billions (B)
- Every report must include: summary, detail section, analysis, and recommendations
- Label one-time or non-recurring items separately from ongoing operations

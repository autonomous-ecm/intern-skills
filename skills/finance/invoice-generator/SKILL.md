# Invoice Generator

## Quick Start
Create structured financial documents (Invoice, Quotation, Receipt, Payment Voucher, Debit Note) with automatic numbering, line-item calculations, sales tax, and amount-in-words verification.

## Workflow
1. Identify the document type: Invoice, Quotation, Receipt, Payment Voucher, or Debit Note
2. Extract details: customer name, line items (description, quantity, unit price), discounts, sales tax rate, payment terms
3. Ask for any missing mandatory fields
4. Generate sequential document number (e.g., INV-YYYYMM-XXXX)
5. Calculate line totals, apply discounts, compute sales tax (varies by state/locality)
6. Generate amount in words and verify it matches the figures
7. Set payment terms and due dates (quotations default to 30 days validity)
8. Output the complete structured document

## Examples

Input: "Create an invoice for ABC Corp: 10 units of Widget A at $50.00 each"

## Tools
- Use `Read` to load customer records and previous document sequences
- Use `Grep` to search for related documents by customer or document number
- Use `Write` to save generated documents and update the sequence counter
- Use `Bash` to perform arithmetic for totals, sales tax, and discounts

## Error Handling
- If customer name or line items are missing -> ask user to provide them
- If sales tax rate is unspecified -> ask user to provide state/locality or apply a common default rate and inform the user
- If amount in words does not match figures -> recalculate and correct before output
- If duplicate document number is detected -> increment sequence and regenerate
- If unsupported document type is requested -> list the five supported types

## Rules
- Document number formats: INV-YYYYMM-XXXX, QUO-YYYYMM-XXXX, REC-YYYYMM-XXXX, PV-YYYYMM-XXXX, DN-YYYYMM-XXXX
- Sales tax rates vary by state and locality; ask user to specify when not provided
- Quotations valid for 30 days by default
- Invoices overdue by 15 days trigger a reminder notation
- Amount in words must always match amount in figures
- Default currency is USD
- Every document must include: document number, date, customer, at least one line item, and total

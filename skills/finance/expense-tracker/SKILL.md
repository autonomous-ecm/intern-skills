# Expense Tracker

## Quick Start
Record, categorize, and monitor business expenses against budgets. Validate documentation, detect duplicates, and alert when spending approaches category limits.

## Workflow
1. Parse expense details from user input: item, amount, date, category, department, project
2. Classify into a category: Operations, HR, Marketing, IT, Travel, or Other
3. Ask for any missing required fields (amount, date, category)
4. Check for duplicate entries in existing records
5. Calculate budget impact: cumulative spend, remaining budget, percentage used
6. Flag expenses over $500 for manager approval
7. Generate alerts if spending reaches 80%+ of category budget
8. Output structured expense record with budget status

## Examples

**Example 1: Recording an office expense**
Input: "Log $625.00 for new office chairs, Operations department, March 15"
Output:

## Tools
- Use `Read` to load budget files and historical expense data
- Use `Grep` to search for duplicate or related expense entries
- Use `Write` to persist new expense records and update running totals
- Use `Bash` to run calculations on aggregated expense data

## Error Handling
- If required fields are missing (amount, date, category) -> ask user to provide them
- If expense category is unclear -> present the category list and ask user to choose
- If budget data is unavailable -> record the expense but note budget comparison is not possible
- If duplicate entry is detected -> warn user and ask for confirmation before recording

## Rules
- All expenses must reference supporting documents (invoices, receipts)
- Alert when spending reaches 80% of category budget
- Default currency is USD
- Expenses over $500 require manager approval notation
- Every expense must be tied to a category, department, and date
- Round to two decimal places

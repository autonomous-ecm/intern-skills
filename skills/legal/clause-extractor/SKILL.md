# Clause Extractor

## Quick Start
Extract, categorize, and compare specific clauses from legal documents. Useful for building clause libraries, comparing terms across vendors, or identifying standard vs. non-standard provisions.

## Workflow
1. Identify the target clauses: termination, liability, payment, confidentiality, IP, indemnification, SLA, etc.
2. Read the document(s) provided
3. Locate and extract each target clause with its exact wording
4. Categorize by clause type and label as standard/non-standard/aggressive
5. If comparing multiple documents, create a side-by-side comparison
6. Summarize findings with recommendations

## Examples

**Example 1: Extract Key Clauses**
Input: "Extract all payment and termination clauses from this vendor contract"
Output:
```

PAYMENT CLAUSES
---------------
Clause 4.1 — Payment Terms:
  "Client shall pay all invoices within thirty (30) days of receipt.
   Late payments shall accrue interest at 1.5% per month."
  📋 Category: Payment Terms
  🏷️ Assessment: Standard — 30-day net is typical

Clause 4.3 — Price Adjustment:
  "Provider reserves the right to adjust pricing with sixty (60) days
   written notice. Continued use constitutes acceptance of new pricing."
  📋 Category: Price Escalation
  🏷️ Assessment: Non-standard — no cap on increases, acceptance by inaction

TERMINATION CLAUSES
-------------------
Clause 8.1 — Termination for Convenience:
  "Either party may terminate with ninety (90) days written notice."
  📋 Category: Convenience Termination
  🏷️ Assessment: Standard — mutual right, reasonable notice period

Clause 8.3 — Effect of Termination:
  "Upon termination, Client shall pay all outstanding fees and return
   all Provider materials. Provider shall retain all data for 90 days."
  📋 Category: Post-Termination
  🏷️ Assessment: Review needed — data retention clause may conflict with
   data protection requirements

SUMMARY
-------
Total clauses extracted: 4
Standard: 2 | Non-standard: 1 | Needs review: 1

⚠️ Flag: Clause 4.3 allows unlimited price increases with passive acceptance.
   Recommend negotiating a price cap or active consent requirement.
```

**Example 2: Multi-Contract Comparison**
Input: "Compare the SLA clauses across these 3 vendor proposals"
Output:
```
CLAUSE COMPARISON
=================
Clause Type: Service Level Agreement (SLA)

| Term           | Vendor A       | Vendor B       | Vendor C       |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Uptime         | 99.9%          | 99.5%          | 99.95%         |
| Measurement    | Monthly        | Quarterly      | Monthly        |
| Credits        | 10% per 0.1%  | 5% per 0.5%   | 15% per 0.1%  |
| Max Credit     | 30% monthly    | 10% quarterly  | 100% monthly   |
| Exclusions     | Maintenance    | Maintenance+3rd| Maintenance    |
| Response Time  | 1hr critical   | 4hr critical   | 30min critical |

RECOMMENDATION: Vendor C offers the strongest SLA terms with highest
uptime guarantee and most generous credit structure.

## Tools
- Use `Read` to load contracts and legal documents
- Use `Grep` to search for specific clause keywords across documents
- Use `Write` to save extracted clauses or comparison reports
- Use `Glob` to find multiple contract files in a directory

## Error Handling
- If clause type not specified → ask which clauses to extract or offer common categories
- If clause is ambiguous or poorly defined → extract as-is and flag for review
- If document format prevents clean extraction → note formatting issues
- If clause references external documents → note the dependency

## Rules
- Always preserve the exact original wording when extracting clauses
- Label each clause with: section reference, category, and standard/non-standard assessment
- For comparisons, use tabular format for easy scanning
- Flag any clause that deviates significantly from industry standards
- Note cross-references between clauses (e.g., termination triggers payment obligations)
- Include the document source and extraction date for traceability
- Never modify or paraphrase clause language without clearly marking it as a summary

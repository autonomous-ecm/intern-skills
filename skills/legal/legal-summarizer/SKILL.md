# Legal Summarizer

## Quick Start
Convert complex legal documents into clear, structured plain-language summaries. Extract key obligations, rights, deadlines, and penalties. Always note that summaries are for informational purposes, not legal advice.

## Workflow
1. Identify document type: law/regulation, contract, court ruling, policy, terms of service, legal memo
2. Read the full document or specified sections
3. Extract: purpose, scope, key definitions, obligations, rights, penalties, deadlines, exemptions
4. Organize into a structured plain-language summary
5. Highlight critical dates, monetary thresholds, and compliance requirements
6. Note areas of ambiguity or sections requiring legal interpretation

## Error Handling
- If document is in legal language that is ambiguous → flag specific ambiguities

- If only partial document provided → summarize available content and note what is missing
- If user asks for legal interpretation → clarify this is a summary, not legal advice

## Rules

- Always include: purpose, key obligations, penalties, and important deadlines

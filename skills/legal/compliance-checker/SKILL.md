# Compliance Checker

## Quick Start
Evaluate business processes and documents against regulatory frameworks and internal policies. Identify gaps, flag non-compliance risks, and suggest remediation steps. Always specify which regulation or standard is being checked against.

## Workflow
1. Identify the compliance framework: GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, HIPAA, SOX, labor law, ISO 27001, SOC 2, industry-specific regulations
2. Determine what is being evaluated: a document, process, policy, or system
3. Map requirements from the framework to the subject being evaluated
4. Check each requirement: compliant, partially compliant, non-compliant, or not applicable
5. Assign risk levels to non-compliant items
6. Provide remediation recommendations with priority ranking

## Examples

**Example 1: Data Privacy Check**
Input: "Check if our customer data collection process complies with CCPA"
Output:
```
COMPLIANCE CHECK
================
Framework: CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
Subject: Customer data collection process
Date: 03/23/2026

ASSESSMENT

| # | Requirement                    | Status         | Risk   |
|---|--------------------------------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | Privacy notice at collection   | ✅ Compliant    | —      |
| 2 | Purpose specification          | ⚠️ Partial     | Medium |
| 3 | Data minimization              | ❌ Non-compliant| HIGH   |
| 4 | Storage limitation             | ⚠️ Partial     | Medium |
| 5 | Right to know / access         | ❌ Non-compliant| HIGH   |
| 6 | Data breach notification       | ✅ Compliant    | —      |
| 7 | Opt-out of sale/sharing        | ❌ Non-compliant| HIGH   |
| 8 | Non-discrimination             | ✅ Compliant    | —      |

Score: 3/8 fully compliant (37.5%)

HIGH RISK ITEMS:
1. Data minimization: Collecting 12 fields when only 5 are needed for stated purpose
2. Right to know: No self-service portal for consumers to view/delete their data
3. Opt-out mechanism: No "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" link on website

REMEDIATION PLAN:
| Priority | Action                                  | Deadline   |
|----------|-----------------------------------------|------------|
| P0       | Reduce data fields to minimum necessary | Immediate  |
| P0       | Implement consumer rights request process | 30 days    |
| P1       | Add "Do Not Sell or Share" opt-out link | 60 days    |
| P2       | Update privacy policy with specific purposes | 30 days |
| P2       | Define data retention schedule          | 45 days    |
```

**Example 2: Labor Law Check**
Input: "Check if our employee handbook complies with US labor law"
Output: A section-by-section review of the handbook against FLSA, FMLA, ADA, OSHA, Title VII, and state-specific requirements.

## Tools
- Use `Read` to load policy documents, handbooks, or process descriptions
- Use `WebSearch` to verify current regulatory requirements and recent updates
- Use `Write` to save compliance reports to files
- Use `Grep` to search for specific terms or clauses in documents

## Error Handling
- If compliance framework not specified → ask which regulations or standards to check against
- If document is incomplete → note gaps and assess only available content
- If regulation has recently changed → flag that requirements may need re-verification
- If assessment requires domain expertise beyond scope → recommend specialist consultation

## Rules
- Always specify which version/date of the regulation is being referenced
- Never claim a process is "fully compliant" — use "appears compliant based on available information"
- Flag items requiring specialist legal or regulatory review
- Prioritize remediation actions by risk level (P0 = immediate, P1 = 30 days, P2 = 60 days)
- Include both the requirement and the evidence (or lack of) for each assessment
- Note that compliance is a point-in-time assessment and requires ongoing monitoring
- Keep assessment objective — note assumptions clearly

# Contract Reviewer

## Quick Start
Review contracts by identifying key terms, obligations, risks, and missing clauses. Highlight unfavorable terms and suggest improvements. Never provide legal advice — flag items for legal counsel review.

## Workflow
1. Identify contract type: employment, service agreement, NDA, vendor, lease, partnership, SLA
2. Read the full contract document
3. Extract key terms: parties, duration, payment, termination, liability, confidentiality, IP ownership
4. Identify risk areas: one-sided clauses, unlimited liability, auto-renewal traps, broad non-compete
5. Check for missing standard clauses: force majeure, dispute resolution, data protection
6. Generate a structured review with risk ratings (High/Medium/Low)

## Examples

**Example 1: Service Agreement Review**
Input: "Review this service agreement with our IT vendor"
Output:
```
CONTRACT REVIEW
===============
Type: Service Agreement
Parties: [Company] ↔ [IT Vendor]
Effective Date: 04/01/2026
Duration: 24 months, auto-renewal

KEY TERMS
---------
| Term              | Details                           | Risk    |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|---------|
| Payment           | Monthly, net 30 days              | Low     |
| SLA Uptime        | 99.5% guaranteed                  | Medium  |
| Liability Cap     | Not specified                     | HIGH    |
| Termination       | 90 days notice, no early exit fee | Low     |
| Auto-Renewal      | 12-month auto-renewal             | Medium  |
| IP Ownership      | Vendor retains all IP             | HIGH    |
| Data Protection   | Not addressed                     | HIGH    |

RISK SUMMARY
-------------
HIGH RISK:
1. No liability cap — company exposed to unlimited damages
2. Vendor retains all IP — including customizations built for your use case
3. No data protection clause — non-compliant with CCPA/GDPR

MEDIUM RISK:
4. 99.5% SLA is below industry standard (99.9%)
5. Auto-renewal locks in 12 months without renegotiation

MISSING CLAUSES:
- Force majeure
- Data processing agreement (DPA)
- Escrow for source code
- Change management procedure

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add a liability cap (suggest: 12 months of fees)
2. Negotiate IP ownership for custom developments
3. Add a data protection / DPA clause
4. Request 99.9% SLA with service credits
5. Change auto-renewal to require mutual written consent

⚠️ Recommend legal counsel review before signing.

**Example 2: Quick Comparison**
Input: "Compare these two versions of the lease agreement and highlight changes"
Output: A side-by-side comparison of modified clauses with risk impact assessment.

## Tools
- Use `Read` to load contract documents and reference files
- Use `Grep` to search for specific clauses or terms within contracts
- Use `Write` to save the review report to a file

## Error Handling
- If contract is incomplete or missing pages → note the gaps and review available content
- If contract type is unclear → ask user to specify the nature of the agreement
- If terms are ambiguous → flag them as needing clarification from the counterparty
- If user asks for legal advice → clarify that this is a review aid, not legal counsel

## Rules
- NEVER provide legal advice — always recommend professional legal counsel for final decisions
- Flag all one-sided or unusual clauses explicitly
- Rate every key term as High/Medium/Low risk
- Always check for these standard clauses: liability cap, termination, confidentiality, IP, data protection, force majeure, dispute resolution
- Preserve original contract language when quoting clauses
- Compare against industry-standard terms when assessing fairness
- Note jurisdiction and governing law if specified

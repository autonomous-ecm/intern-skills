# Vendor Evaluator

## Quick Start
Evaluate vendors using a structured scoring model across key criteria: pricing, quality, delivery, reliability, compliance, and support. Produce ranked comparisons with clear recommendations.

## Workflow
1. Identify evaluation context: new vendor selection, renewal assessment, or vendor performance review
2. Define evaluation criteria and weights (or use defaults)
3. Gather vendor information: proposals, quotes, references, past performance
4. Score each vendor on each criterion (1-10 scale)
5. Calculate weighted scores and rank vendors
6. Provide a recommendation with rationale and risk notes

## Examples

**Example 1: Vendor Comparison**
Input: "Compare these 3 office supply vendors and pick the best one"
Output:

| Criteria         | Weight | Vendor A | Vendor B | Vendor C |
|------------------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Pricing          | 30%    | 8/10     | 9/10     | 6/10     |

| RANK             |        | #1       | #3       | #2       |

RECOMMENDATION: Vendor A
Rationale: Best overall balance of pricing and delivery speed. While Vendor C
has higher quality, Vendor A's pricing advantage (30% weight) and fastest
delivery make it the strongest choice for office supplies.

RISK NOTES:
- Vendor A: Slightly lower quality score — request sample order first
- Vendor B: Slowest delivery — may cause issues for urgent orders
- Vendor C: Highest pricing — 25% above Vendor A on comparable items
```

**Example 2: Single Vendor Assessment**
Input: "Evaluate this IT vendor for a 2-year contract"
Output: A detailed single-vendor scorecard with pass/fail recommendation.

## Tools
- Use `Read` to load vendor proposals, quotes, or performance data
- Use `Write` to save evaluation reports
- Use `WebSearch` to research vendor reputation and reviews
- Use `Bash` to calculate weighted scores from data files

## Error Handling
- If vendor information is incomplete → note gaps and score only available criteria
- If criteria weights not specified → use default weights and confirm with user
- If scores are subjective → ask user to provide ratings or evidence
- If vendors are too close in score → highlight differentiating factors

## Rules
- Use a 1-10 scoring scale consistently across all vendors
- All scores must be justified with specific evidence or rationale
- Default criteria weights: Price 30%, Quality 25%, Delivery 20%, Support 15%, Terms 10%
- Always include risk notes for each vendor
- Flag any vendor with a score below 5 on any criterion as a concern
- For tied scores, recommend based on the highest-weighted criterion
- Include both quantitative scores and qualitative observations
- Currency comparisons in USD unless otherwise specified

# Price Comparator

## Quick Start
Compare prices across vendors or products with structured breakdowns including unit costs, volume discounts, hidden fees, and total cost of ownership (TCO). Present clear side-by-side comparisons with savings calculations.

## Workflow
1. Identify comparison scope: same product across vendors, or different products/plans
2. Collect pricing data: unit price, quantity discounts, fees, delivery costs, payment terms
3. Normalize pricing to the same unit and currency for fair comparison
4. Calculate TCO including hidden costs: setup, maintenance, shipping, warranties
5. Generate side-by-side comparison with savings analysis
6. Recommend the best option with rationale

## Examples

**Example 1: Vendor Price Comparison**
Input: "Compare prices from 3 A4 paper suppliers for an order of 500 reams"
Output:

RANKING BY TOTAL COST:
1. Vendor B: $1,171.80 (cheapest)
2. Vendor A: $1,182.60 (+$10.80 / +0.9%)
3. Vendor C: $1,242.00 (+$70.20 / +6.0%)

SAVINGS: Choosing Vendor B saves $70.20 vs most expensive option.

RECOMMENDATION: Vendor B offers best price, but requires COD payment.
If cash flow is a concern, Vendor A is 0.9% more but offers Net 30 terms.

**Example 2: Subscription Plan Comparison**
Input: "Compare pricing plans for these 3 project management tools"
Output: Monthly/annual cost comparison with feature matrix and per-user TCO.

## Tools
- Use `Read` to load vendor quotes and price lists
- Use `Write` to save comparison reports
- Use `WebSearch` to verify current pricing or find additional vendors
- Use `Bash` to calculate totals and percentages

## Error Handling
- If pricing is in different currencies → convert to a single currency and note exchange rate
- If some cost components are missing → note assumptions and mark estimated values
- If volume discounts have complex tiers → calculate for the specific quantity requested
- If pricing has expired → flag the date and suggest re-quoting

## Rules
- Always normalize to the same unit (per piece, per month, per user) for fair comparison
- Include ALL costs: unit price, discounts, shipping, taxes, setup fees, hidden fees
- Calculate total cost of ownership, not just sticker price
- Show both absolute difference and percentage difference
- Rank options by total cost with clear #1, #2, #3
- Note non-price factors: payment terms, delivery speed, minimum orders
- Currency defaults to USD; show exchange rate when converting
- Flag any pricing that seems unusually low (potential quality concern)

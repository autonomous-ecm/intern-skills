# PO Generator

## Quick Start
Generate structured Purchase Orders with vendor details, line items, pricing, delivery terms, and approval requirements. Validate totals and flag orders requiring additional approval based on amount thresholds.

## Workflow
1. Gather PO details: vendor, requester, department, delivery date
2. Collect line items: item description, quantity, unit price, specifications
3. Calculate subtotals, taxes (sales tax, varies by state), and grand total
4. Determine approval level based on total amount
5. Generate the formatted PO document
6. Flag any items requiring special procurement procedures

## Examples

**Example 1: Standard PO**
Input: "Create a PO to purchase 50 office desk and chair sets from ABC Furniture Co., unit price $350/set"
Output:

## Tools
- Use `Read` to load vendor quotes, price lists, or PO templates
- Use `Write` to save generated POs to files
- Use `Bash` to calculate totals and taxes

## Error Handling
- If vendor details are missing → create PO with placeholders and list required fields
- If unit price not specified → leave blank and flag for pricing confirmation
- If tax rate unclear → default to applicable state sales tax and note the assumption
- If delivery date not specified → flag as required before submission

## Rules
- PO numbers follow format: PO-YYYY-[sequential]
- Default tax: Sales tax (varies by state); specify if different
- Approval thresholds: ≤$100,000 (Dept Manager), >$100,000 (Finance Director), >$250,000 (CEO)
- All amounts must show subtotal, tax, and grand total
- Always include: vendor details, line items, delivery terms, payment terms
- Currency defaults to USD
- Quantities must be positive whole numbers
- Flag items over $5,000 individually for asset tracking

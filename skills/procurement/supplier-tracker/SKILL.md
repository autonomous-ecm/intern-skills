# Supplier Tracker

## Quick Start
Maintain a structured supplier database with contract details, performance metrics, and upcoming renewals. Track delivery reliability, quality scores, and flag contracts approaching expiration.

## Workflow
1. Determine action: add supplier, update record, check status, review performance, list renewals
2. Gather or update supplier details: company info, contracts, contacts, performance data
3. Calculate performance metrics: on-time delivery rate, quality score, response time
4. Flag upcoming contract renewals (30/60/90 day warnings)
5. Generate the requested view: single supplier profile, renewal calendar, or performance summary

## Examples

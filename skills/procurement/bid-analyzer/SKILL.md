# Bid Analyzer

## Quick Start
Evaluate bid submissions using a structured two-envelope method (technical + financial). Score proposals against predefined criteria, rank bidders, and provide selection recommendations with full transparency.

## Workflow
1. Review tender requirements and evaluation criteria
2. Parse bid submissions: technical proposals and financial offers
3. Score technical proposals against requirements (pass/fail threshold: 70%)
4. Evaluate financial proposals for qualified bidders only
5. Calculate combined scores (default: Technical 60%, Financial 40%)
6. Rank bidders and provide selection recommendation with rationale

## Examples

**Example 1: Bid Evaluation**
Input: "Evaluate 3 bid submissions for a security camera system"
Output:

FINANCIAL EVALUATION (Qualified bidders only)
----------------------------------------------
| Component              | Bidder A         | Bidder B         | Bidder C         |
|------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Equipment Cost         | $450,000         | $380,000         | $520,000         |
| Installation           | $80,000          | $95,000          | $65,000          |
| Annual Maintenance     | $25,000          | $30,000          | $20,000          |
| 3-Year TCO             | $605,000         | $565,000         | $645,000         |

(Financial Score = Lowest Bid ÷ Bidder's Bid × 100)

COMBINED SCORE (Technical 60% + Financial 40%)
-----------------------------------------------
| Bidder   | Technical (60%) | Financial (40%) | Combined | Rank |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|------|
| Bidder A | 51.0            | 37.4            | 88.4     | #1   |
| Bidder B | 49.8            | 40.0            | 89.8     | #1   |
| Bidder C | 45.0            | 35.0            | 80.0     | #3   |

RECOMMENDATION: Bidder B
- Highest combined score (89.8)
- Lowest 3-year TCO ($565K)
- Strong technical capability with best implementation plan

NOTES:
- All 3 bidders passed technical threshold (≥70)
- Bidder B saves $40K over 3 years vs Bidder A
- Bidder C's lower technical score and highest cost make it least favorable

**Example 2: Quick Bid Summary**
Input: "Summarize these 5 bids for the office renovation project"
Output: A summary table with key metrics and quick recommendation.

## Tools
- Use `Read` to load bid documents and tender requirements
- Use `Write` to save evaluation reports
- Use `Bash` to calculate scores and rankings
- Use `Grep` to search for specific terms in bid documents

## Error Handling
- If evaluation criteria not defined → propose standard criteria and confirm with user
- If a bid is incomplete → note missing components and score only available sections
- If technical scores are tied → use financial score as tiebreaker
- If all bids fail technical threshold → recommend re-tendering

## Rules
- Technical evaluation always comes before financial evaluation
- Only technically qualified bidders (≥70/100) proceed to financial evaluation
- Default weighting: Technical 60%, Financial 40% (adjustable per tender)
- Financial scoring formula: (Lowest Bid ÷ Bidder's Bid) × 100
- All scoring must be transparent and documented
- Compare Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), not just upfront price
- Flag any abnormally low bids (>30% below average) as potential risk
- Note any non-compliant or conditional bids explicitly
- Maintain fairness — evaluate all bidders against the same criteria

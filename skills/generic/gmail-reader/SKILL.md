# Gmail Reader

## Quick Start
Search and retrieve Gmail messages via the Gmail API using `users.messages.list` and `users.messages.get`. Parse message headers and body, then present a clean readable summary. Requires `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly` scope.

## Workflow
1. Determine the request type: search, read thread, list unread, or summarize inbox
2. Build the query string using Gmail search operators (from:, to:, subject:, is:unread, after:, before:, has:attachment, label:)
3. Call `GET /gmail/v1/users/me/messages?q=<query>` to get matching message IDs
4. Fetch full message details via `GET /gmail/v1/users/me/messages/<id>?format=full`
5. Decode the message body (base64url) and extract headers: From, To, Subject, Date
6. Present formatted results — summary for lists, full content for single message reads

## Examples

**Example 1: Search emails from a sender**
Input: "Show me emails from john@example.com this week"
Output:
```

## Tools
- Use `WebFetch` to call Gmail API endpoints with the user's OAuth access token
- Use `Bash` with curl as fallback for API calls

## Error Handling
- If no OAuth token provided → explain the user must authenticate with `gmail.readonly` scope first
- If `401 Unauthorized` → token expired; ask user to re-authenticate
- If `403 Forbidden` → scope not granted; request `gmail.readonly` scope
- If query returns 0 results → suggest broadening the search (remove date filters, check spelling)
- If message body is empty → check for multipart MIME parts; try `text/plain` then `text/html`

## Rules
- Scope required: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`
- Base URL: `https://gmail.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me`
- Always include `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header
- Message body is base64url encoded — always decode before displaying
- For multipart messages: prefer `text/plain` part; fall back to `text/html` (strip tags)
- Default `userId` is `me` (authenticated user)
- Never display raw base64 content to the user
- Max results per page: 100 (use `pageToken` for pagination)
- Common search operators: `from:`, `to:`, `subject:`, `is:unread`, `is:starred`, `has:attachment`, `label:`, `after:YYYY/MM/DD`, `before:YYYY/MM/DD`

# CRM Helper

## Quick Start
Describe what you need: log an activity, update a deal stage, review your pipeline, or generate a forecast. Provide deal names, contact details, or CRM exports as needed. The skill ensures pipeline hygiene and actionable outputs.

## Workflow
1. Parse the request: add/update a record, view pipeline, log an activity, generate forecast, or run win/loss analysis
2. Identify scope: single deal, specific pipeline stage, full pipeline, or time-bound period
3. Gather current state (deal stage, last activity, value, owner) for accurate updates
4. Map to standard pipeline stages: Prospecting → Qualified → Proposal Sent → Negotiation → Closed Won / Closed Lost
5. Execute the requested action (log, update, aggregate, forecast, or flag risks)
6. Surface at-risk deals: stale (30+ days without activity), slipped close dates, or missing next steps
7. Deliver structured output with actionable recommendations

## Examples

**Example 1: Log a meeting**
Input: "Log a meeting with Sarah Chen at NovaTech. We did a 45-minute product demo, she loved the reporting features, and we agreed to send a proposal by Friday."
Output:
```
## Activity Log
- Type: Meeting (Demo)
- Contact: Sarah Chen, NovaTech
- Date: 03/18/2026
- Duration: 45 minutes
- Outcome: Completed
- Key Notes: Positive response to reporting features. Strong interest in dashboard customization.
- Next Step: Send proposal — 03/21/2026

Deal Update: NovaTech moved from Qualified → Proposal Sent
```

**Example 2: Pipeline review**
Input: "Give me a pipeline overview for Q1"
Output:
```

- Pipeline value: $1,850,000

- Average deal size: $77,083
- Win rate: 32%
- Average sales cycle: 47 days

## Pipeline by Stage
| Stage | Deals | Value | Weighted Value | Avg Age |
|-------|-------|-------|----------------|---------|
| Prospecting | 8 | $480,000 | $48,000 | 12 days |
| Qualified | 7 | $560,000 | $168,000 | 28 days |

## At-Risk Deals
| Deal | Risk Reason | Days Inactive | Action |
|------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Acme - Platform | Stale | 38 days | Re-engage or downgrade |
| Bolt - Analytics | No next step | 22 days | Define next step immediately |
```

## Tools
- Use `Read` to access CRM exports, deal spreadsheets, or activity logs
- Use `WebFetch` to pull data from CRM web interfaces if URLs are provided
- Use `WebSearch` to enrich CRM records with external company intelligence

## Error Handling
- If deal or contact cannot be identified → ask for deal name, contact name, or CRM record ID
- If pipeline stage is ambiguous → present the standard 6-stage pipeline and ask for confirmation
- If forecast data is insufficient → generate forecast with explicit caveats about data quality
- If activity details are vague → prompt for interaction type, outcomes, and next step

## Rules
- Every deal must have a defined next step with a specific date
- Flag stale deals (30+ days without activity) for review: re-engage, downgrade, or close lost
- Forecast probabilities must be evidence-based — never inflated to meet targets
- CRM is the single source of truth — all sales info must be recorded
- Consistent formatting: currency in one format, dates as MM/DD/YYYY, deal names as [Company - Product/Service]
- Log activities immediately — details degrade over time

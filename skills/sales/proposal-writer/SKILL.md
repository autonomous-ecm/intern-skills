# Proposal Writer

## Quick Start
Provide the client name, their core need, and approximate budget range. The skill produces a complete sales proposal with executive summary, needs analysis, solution design, 3-tier pricing, implementation timeline, and next steps.

## Workflow
1. Extract deal parameters: client name, industry, deal size, scope, and requirements
2. Classify document type: full proposal, quick quotation, pitch deck outline, or RFP response
3. Identify gaps in context and ask for missing critical info before drafting
4. Write executive summary (problem → solution → outcome, under one page)
5. Map client pain points to business impact in a needs analysis table
6. Design the solution with features tied explicitly to client benefits
7. Build 3-tier pricing (Standard / Professional / Enterprise) with ROI projections
8. Create implementation timeline with milestones and deliverables
9. Define time-bound next steps with 30-day proposal validity

## Examples

**Example 1: Full proposal**
Input: "Write a proposal for DataFlow Inc. They need a customer analytics platform. Budget is around $150K."
Output:
```
Sales Proposal: Customer Analytics Platform

Client: DataFlow Inc.
Date: 03/18/2026
Estimated Deal Value: $150,000
Proposal Valid Until: 04/17/2026

## Executive Summary
DataFlow Inc. currently relies on fragmented spreadsheet-based reporting, costing an estimated 30+ hours per week in manual analysis. Our analytics platform consolidates all customer data into real-time dashboards, enabling DataFlow to reduce reporting time by 80% and surface revenue opportunities 3x faster. Within 90 days of deployment, DataFlow can expect a measurable uplift in customer retention through data-driven engagement.

## Tools
- Use `Read` to access client briefs, prior proposals, pricing sheets, or case study files
- Use `WebSearch` to research client industry trends, news, or competitive landscape
- Use `WebFetch` to pull client web pages or competitor pricing for positioning

## Error Handling
- If client name or deal context is missing → ask for at minimum client name, core need, and budget range
- If pricing info is unavailable → generate template with placeholder pricing marked for user input
- If proposal type is ambiguous → present options (full proposal, quotation, pitch deck) and confirm

## Rules
- Always lead with value and outcomes, never features alone
- Personalize every section to the specific client — no generic proposals
- Structure pricing in 3 tiers using anchoring psychology toward the recommended option
- Include a 30-day validity period on all proposals
- Plan follow-up cadence: day 3, day 7, day 14
- Never overstate capabilities or make undeliverable promises
- Keep the executive summary under one page

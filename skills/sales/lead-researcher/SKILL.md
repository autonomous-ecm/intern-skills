# Lead Researcher

## Quick Start
Provide a company name (or criteria like industry/size/location) and any known context. The skill will produce a structured research brief with company profile, decision-maker map, pain point analysis, and BANT lead score.

## Workflow
1. Parse the target company name, industry, or lead criteria from user input
2. Classify the request: single-company deep dive, multi-lead list build, lead qualification, or pre-call briefing
3. Compile firmographic data (industry, size, revenue, location, funding)
4. Map decision makers (C-level, VP, Director) with titles and LinkedIn profiles
5. Surface business intelligence: recent news, hiring signals, tech stack, current vendors
6. Analyze pain points and map them to solution value propositions
7. Score the lead using BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline) on a 0-100 scale
8. Deliver the structured research brief with a recommended next action

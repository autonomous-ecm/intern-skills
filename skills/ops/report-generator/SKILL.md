# Report Generator

## Quick Start
Produce executive-level operational reports with data-backed analysis and actionable recommendations. Determine the report type and period, collect and validate data, compute period-over-period comparisons, and deliver a structured report with an executive summary and specific action items.

## Workflow
1. Classify report type: weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual, or ad-hoc (incident/issue)
2. Confirm the reporting period (start/end dates) and comparison period
3. Identify data sources and required metrics/KPIs
4. Collect and validate data -- flag any gaps or inconsistencies
5. Compute period-over-period changes with directional indicators
6. Write the executive summary (2-3 sentences, most critical findings)
7. Populate metrics table, detailed analysis, achievements, challenges, and recommendations
8. Verify all numbers for internal consistency before delivering

## Examples

**Example 1: Weekly Report**
Input: "Generate a weekly ops report for March 9-15, 2026. We processed 1,250 orders (last week was 1,100), had 3 incidents (down from 5), and team utilization was 87%."
Output:
```

## Tools
- Use `Read` to load data files, prior reports, or KPI definitions
- Use `Write` to save the generated report to the specified output path
- Use `Grep` to search for historical data, prior-period values, or specific metrics across files
- Use `Glob` to locate data sources, previous report files, or templates in the workspace

## Error Handling
- If report type is not specified → present options (weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual, ad-hoc) and ask the user to choose
- If reporting period is ambiguous → ask for exact start and end dates
- If input data is incomplete → list missing data points, proceed with available data, and mark incomplete sections
- If prior-period data is unavailable → note the absence, present current-period data only, and recommend establishing a baseline
- If metrics show extreme anomalies (>50% change) → flag prominently and request user verification

## Rules
- All data must include units and be compared against the prior period where possible
- Use directional indicators consistently: [UP] for increase, [DOWN] for decrease, [STABLE] for no significant change
- Analyze root causes for any metric that deviates significantly from expectations
- Executive summary: maximum 3 sentences focused on the most impactful findings
- Every action item must include: what, who is responsible, and deadline
- Never fabricate or estimate data; mark unavailable values as "N/A" with explanation
- Reports must be internally consistent -- totals must match the sum of components

# Inventory Tracker

## Quick Start
Manage office inventory and equipment with full audit trails. Perform stock checks, allocate/retrieve equipment, generate purchase orders, and run inventory audits. Every change is logged with timestamp, person, and reason.

## Workflow
1. Classify the operation: stock check, allocation, retrieval, reorder/purchase request, or audit
2. Identify target items by name, asset code, or category (office supplies, IT equipment, furniture)
3. Gather parameters: quantities, employee name (for allocation/retrieval), reason for change
4. Load current inventory data and cross-reference records
5. Execute the operation and log the change with timestamp, responsible person, and reason
6. Generate alerts for any items below 20% of minimum threshold
7. Deliver the structured report or confirmation

## Examples

**Example 1: Stock Check**
Input: "What's the current stock level for printer ink and A4 paper?"
Output:
```
Inventory Report
---------------------------------------
Date: 03/18/2026
Operation: Stock Check
Performed By: [Requestor]

Item Summary:
| Item            | Asset Code | In Stock | Minimum | Status |
|-----------------|------------|----------|---------|--------|
| Printer Ink     | SUP-0042   | 8        | 10      | LOW    |
| A4 Paper (ream) | SUP-0015   | 45       | 20      | OK     |

Alerts:
- Printer Ink: Current stock (8) is below minimum threshold (10). Recommended reorder: 20 units.
---------------------------------------
```

**Example 2: Equipment Allocation**
Input: "Allocate a MacBook Pro (asset MBP-0112) to new hire Michael Chen starting today."
Output:
```
Inventory Report
---------------------------------------
Date: 03/18/2026
Operation: Allocation
Performed By: IT Admin

Item Summary:
| Item        | Asset Code | In Stock | Minimum | Status |
|-------------|------------|----------|---------|--------|
| MacBook Pro | MBP-0112   | 4 → 3   | 5       | LOW    |

Change Log:
- 03/18/2026 09:00 | IT Admin | MacBook Pro (MBP-0112) | -1 | Allocated to Michael Chen (new hire onboarding)

Alerts:
- MacBook Pro: Current stock (3) is below minimum threshold (5). Recommended reorder: 5 units.
---------------------------------------
```

## Tools
- Use `Read` to load existing inventory records, asset registries, or threshold configuration files
- Use `Write` to save updated inventory records, purchase orders, or audit reports
- Use `Grep` to search for specific asset codes or item names across inventory logs
- Use `Glob` to locate inventory data files, templates, or historical audit reports

## Error Handling
- If the item does not exist in the registry → ask the user to confirm the name/code and offer to add it as a new entry
- If allocation is requested but stock is insufficient → notify the user and suggest placing a reorder first
- If a retrieval references an asset not allocated to the stated employee → flag the mismatch and request clarification
- If inventory data files are missing or unreadable → inform the user and offer to create a new baseline
- If the operation type is unclear → present available operations and ask the user to choose

## Rules
- Every piece of equipment must have a unique asset code; never create duplicates
- All allocations must include: employee name, date, asset code, and condition
- Trigger a low-stock alert when any item falls below 20% of its minimum threshold
- Every change must be logged with: timestamp, person responsible, item, quantity change, and reason
- Never delete historical records; all changes are append-only for audit purposes
- Monthly audits should compare physical counts against system records

# SOP Creator

## Quick Start
Create structured SOPs with clear objectives, step-by-step procedures, roles and responsibilities, quality checkpoints, and exception handling. Follow a consistent template that ensures processes are repeatable and auditable.

## Workflow
1. Identify the process to document: what, why, who, when, where
2. Gather process details: steps, decision points, inputs, outputs, tools used
3. Define roles and responsibilities (RACI matrix if needed)
4. Write step-by-step procedures with numbered instructions
5. Add quality checkpoints, safety notes, and exception handling
6. Include a revision history and approval section

## Examples

**Example 1: Office Procedure SOP**
Input: "Create an SOP for receiving and processing purchase requests"
Output:

**Example 2: Quick SOP**
Input: "Write an SOP for handling incoming mail and packages"
Output: A shorter SOP with streamlined steps for a simpler process.

## Tools
- Use `Read` to load existing process documents or reference SOPs
- Use `Write` to save SOPs to files
- Use `Grep` to search for related procedures or forms
- Use `Glob` to find existing SOP files in the workspace

## Error Handling
- If process details are vague → ask clarifying questions about specific steps
- If roles are unclear → suggest a RACI matrix and confirm with user
- If process has too many exceptions → suggest simplifying the main flow
- If SOP references other documents → list them in the Documents section

## Rules
- Every SOP must have: purpose, scope, roles, numbered procedures, and revision history
- Steps must be clear enough for someone new to follow without additional guidance
- Include SLA/timeframes for each major step
- Add quality checkpoints (✅) at critical decision points
- Exception handling must cover at least the top 3 most common exceptions
- Keep language simple and use active voice ("Submit the form" not "The form should be submitted")

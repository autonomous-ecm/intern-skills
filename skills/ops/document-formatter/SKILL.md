# Document Formatter

## Quick Start
Create structured, professionally formatted business documents. Determine the document type, gather required fields, apply the correct template, and deliver with proper formatting and section numbering.

## Workflow
1. Classify the document type: internal official letter, meeting minutes, internal announcement, report, or proposal/briefing
2. Gather required fields (date, recipients, subject, body content, signatory) -- ask for any missing information
3. Select and populate the appropriate template with user-provided values
4. Apply formatting rules: section numbering (I, 1, a, -), header/footer, and language-specific styles
5. Verify spelling, grammar, and consistent formatting before delivering the final output
